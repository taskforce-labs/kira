# Target Architecture

## Overview
Design target architecture: components, boundaries, integration points, and design patterns.

## Steps

1. **Constraints and Requirements**
   - Gather technical constraints and non-functional requirements
   - Identify integration and dependency constraints

2. **Components and Boundaries**
   - Define components and their responsibilities
   - Draw boundaries and integration points
   - Apply design patterns appropriate to the domain

3. **Documentation**
   - Document target architecture (diagram or prose)
   - Reference ADRs where relevant
   - Store in project-configured location (e.g. architecture doc in kira.yaml)

## Output

Target architecture document or diagram. Use the technical-discovery skill for detailed guidance.
