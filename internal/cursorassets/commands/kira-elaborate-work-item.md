# Elaborate Work Item

## Overview
Elaborate work items into small testable phases with acceptance criteria and phase sequencing.

## Steps

1. **Read Work Item**
   - Read the work item (e.g. PRD) and current state
   - Identify phases or slices and dependencies

2. **Define Acceptance Criteria**
   - Write concrete, testable criteria per phase/slice
   - Align with Definition of Done

3. **Phase Sequencing**
   - Order phases by dependency and risk
   - Document dependencies between phases
   - Use `kira slice` to add slices and tasks if the project uses them

4. **Update Work Item**
   - Update the work item with phases/slices and criteria
   - Store in project work folder

## Output

Updated work item with phases/slices and acceptance criteria. Use the work-item-elaboration skill for detailed guidance.
