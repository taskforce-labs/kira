# Elaborate Work Item

## Overview
Articulate the details of a work item from its title and description: value, business rules, and flows. Use existing technical context only to understand and inform that articulation; do not include in-depth technical design.

## Steps

1. **Read Work Item and Context**
   - Read the work item (title, description) and any linked docs
   - Review existing technical details only to understand value, rules, and flows

2. **Articulate Value and Business Rules**
   - Clarify the value and outcomes the work item delivers
   - Capture business rules and constraints in plain language

3. **Articulate Flows**
   - Describe user or system flows (steps, decisions, outcomes)
   - Note dependencies and touchpoints with other parts of the system

4. **Update Work Item**
   - Add or refine value, business rules, and flows in the work item
   - Store in project work folder

## Output

Work item with articulated value, business rules, and flows. Use the work-item-elaboration skill for detailed guidance.
